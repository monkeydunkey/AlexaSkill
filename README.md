# Alexa Skill - A simple guide to get songs played during a TV episode

The app simply consumes the user's input and using the parameters for the episode makes a GET request to Tunefind's developer API to fetch the required information.

1. Add checks to handle simple mistakes in TV-show names such as a missing 'The' at the start of the name
2. Perform fuzzy lookup to handle more mistakes in the TV-Show name
